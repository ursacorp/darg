# Darg

A Clojure clone of iDoneThis, designed to be better (and cheaper!) in all regards.

## Development Setup

### Install dependencies

    brew install postgres
    brew install leiningen
    npm install

## Development Flow
This is just my (@venantius) flow, but I think it's informative. I have many windows open at once, but the important windows are the following:
1. `lein run server` - the app
2. `grunt watch` - watch for changes to assets and recompile
3. `lein repl :connect` - a REPL, connected to the app
4. `lein with-profile test test-refresh :growl` - watch the backend file system, running tests when things change, and send me [growl](http://growl.info/) notifications. If you don't have growl installed then just leave off that keyword.

## Usage

`lein run server` to start a server running on localhost:8080

## Deployment

We're deploying to Heroku. At the moment CircleCI is configured to automatically deploy to Heroku on a successful build.

App URL: `http://darg.io`

Git URL: `git@heroku.com:darg.git`

Do the following to set up the app for local development: `git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:darg.git`
