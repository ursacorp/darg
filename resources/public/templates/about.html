      <h4>About</h4>

      <p class="lead">We created Darg with the goal of abolishing status meetings once and for all. </p>

      <p>Darg aims to provide a beautiful and seamless communication tool so that our users can focus on what's truly important to them.</p> 

      <p>Our technology stack is what we jokingly refer to as the "Angre" stack - Angular.js on the frontend, and Clojure on the backend. We are hosted on AWS, and use Postgres as our data storage engine.</p>

      <p>Darg is an UrsaCorp project.</p>
